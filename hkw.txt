My name is Schrijver: writer, in German we could say either schriftsteller or schreiber. Today the word schrifsteller is on the side of the urheber, the creator, someone who makes from nothing. There was a time, however, when writing referred to labour rather than creativity. Most probably my last name originally referred to the person in the community who was able to use the alphabet.

There is an interesting relationship between labour and its fruits. In general working on something does not give you rights to whatever it is you have been working on. If you work in a car factory and you are the person that puts the wheels on the car and later you meet someone driving a car which you’ve put the wheel on, you will not have a say on where they should drive the car. And neither can you ask for some money for the continued use of the wheel.

If the work we do is recognised as being creative, all of a sudden this changes. For, the products of creative work are yours by you having created them. Unless you explicitly sell or otherwise license the rights to your work it is you who gets to decide who gets to copy. 

There is an economic logic to control and an artistic one as well. You will work together with so many people in crafting and sharing your work. Copyright then is your leverage. You can say: yes, but only if.

Once whatever you have made starts to take on a life of its own, creating its connections with the cultural tissue, this power starts to become more dubious. The artist, or whomever they have entrusted to negotiate their rights, becomes a potential censor. The documentary maker cuts out a scene of a playground because a young boy can be overheard singing Rihanna.

Legal considerations influence artistic practice deeply. What a recognisable sample in a piece of music represents today is so very different from what it did 30 years ago. Having a recognisable sample is the equivalent of a Bentley in a video clip: it shows you have the money.

This has less to do with changing tastes than with the long succession of judges ruling that sampling is not a lawful quotation.

I’m not sure a better moment will come for me to do a shout out. To Sabrina Setlur, and Moses Pelham and the Bundesverfassungsgericht.

The highest German court ruled after a legal battle of 20 years on the two seconds sample of Metal auf Metal that producer Moses Pelham used in the beat for Sabrina Setlur’s Nur Mir. That it could be considered as a creative freedom necessary for rap to function. Yet the highest European Court  reined them in again, reining in existing German legal freedoms, the principle of Freie Benutzung, at the same time.
