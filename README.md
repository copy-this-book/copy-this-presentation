# Copy This Presentation

These are the work in progress materials for the lecture-presentation *Copy This Book* relating to the [*Copy This Book: an artist’s guide to copyright*](https://copy-this-book.eu).

You can make appear the different images with the keyboard (with the arrow buttons or individual keys, see source) or through a MIDI controller. The images are currently mapped to the sample pads of a Pioneer SP1. The MIDI API currently works in Google Chrome.

It’s a presentation that runs in the browser. You’ll need to run a small webserver, for instance by entering in your terminal (from within the project’s folder):

> python -m SimpleHTTPServer
